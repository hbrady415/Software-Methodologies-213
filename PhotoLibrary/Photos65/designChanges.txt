					Design changes since storyboard explained
					
Our only major deviation from the initial storyboard is to include a Thumbnail display controller to more clearly demonstrate the back and
forth navigation (manual slideshow) features in the photo view to display the relevant number of images.  We realized after the submission
that it is more intuitive to display all images as a list from which to choose instead of opening an album and sending the user to the 
first photo in an album and navigating from there, displaying the images one at a time.  

We were able to execute this by creating the ThumbController file and splitting the logic we planned to store in two.  The ThumbController
displays a thumbnail and a caption in a table as the intermediate step between visiting the photo list with all of their displayed fields.  
In addition we moved add photo and delete photo into the ThumbController because our previous configuration showing add photo just after 
the location of the visiting photo was confusing for the user.  

Also a create new user button was added to the login page to ease user functionality, considered a minor change because the it 
creates a more realistic scenario but doesn’t impact the existing features.
